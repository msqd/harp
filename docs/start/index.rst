Installation
::::::::::::

Several options exist to install HARP Proxy on your development machine.

The easiest and most reliable method is :doc:`using (docker) containers <docker>`, ensuring you have the exact set of
dependencies, including the system, that we have battle-tested.

For advanced users and fellow pythonistas, you can choose to :doc:`install from PyPI, using pip <python>`. This method
is more flexible but requires a working Python environment and some knowledge of Python.

If you want to :doc:`extend or contribute to HARP </contribute/index>`, consider :doc:`installing from sources
<sources>`.
